Ideas for website adventure game:

JavaScript: Find a book or note (optional to pick up/read). <- This would be a JavaScript button or something to pick up/show/read the item
            this would contain a code/information that can
            be used later in the game to get through a 
            door, choose the right path (maybe the book shows
            a symbol, and the player finds 3 paths with corresponding
            symbols, so if you didn't have the book/note from earlier
            you would not know what path is safe, just an example

Flashlight/torch cursor, use photoshop glow png as cursor, so you only see certain things to note down/click on as you go. 
Possibly have a notepad they can use at the side of the screen/below to note codes/paths/hints they find along the way.
