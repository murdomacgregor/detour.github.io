Detour: A Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game by Murdo Macgregor (40438627)

To play this game, you make your choices by clicking on the decisions below the text on each page. Certain items, paths and decisions will only reveal themselves after being discovered: try clicking on parts of each image that intrigue you, as they will open up new opportunities that may impact your decisions.

Known issues: 
index.html homepage changes the stylesheet to detourstyle.css on load. This is due to a quick fix in the stylesheet switching code on Detour Options.html.
Some audio on the "you died" pages does not load in time for the function to be called. 

These issues will be fixed in due course, but could not be fixed in-time for the coursework submission due to time constraints.

Enjoy!
